# I'm going to make a game.

Right! I'm going to make a game. And I'm going to make this development process open and public. So follow me on Twitch and Twitter:

And I'd like to go through a complete path from the beginning to release it on Steam and (I'll try) Nintendo Switch.

It will be a simple top-down shooter, without any story.

There will be simple enemies with no special abilities but with varying health values: triangle can be killed with one shot, square requires two, pentagon - three, and so on.

The Player's weapon should be bullets-based. One bullet - one dead triangle. So the main properties to upgrade are:
- ammo capacity
- reloading time
- rate of fire
- "fan-out," angle and number of projectiles shot at once
