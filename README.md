# Update 1

## A Pivot!

I understand one crucial thing recently. It would be more useful for me (considering I want to learn methodically right now) not to implement a whole game, but to train my skills implementing various game mechanics!

So right now, I’m building a setup to construct Penrose Tiling (Kites and Darts). Key features are snapping pieces together and controlling available and “forbidden” locations.

# I'm going to make a game.

Right! I'm going to make a game. And I'm going to make this development process open and public. So follow me on Twitch and Twitter:

And I'd like to go through a complete path from the beginning to release it on Steam and (I'll try) Nintendo Switch.

It will be a simple top-down shooter, without any story.

There will be simple enemies with no special abilities but with varying health values: triangle can be killed with one shot, square requires two, pentagon - three, and so on.

The Player's weapon should be bullets-based. One bullet - one dead triangle. So the main properties to upgrade are:
- ammo capacity
- reloading time
- rate of fire
- "fan-out," angle and number of projectiles shot at once
